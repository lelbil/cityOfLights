ideas:
	- add a little photo of the location in the home page

less important ideas:
	- let the user choose between metric and the other system (take one for the yankees)
	- check if a place is open/closed at the time
	-add a 'How to get there' panel
	-Make the add a review page header title says : Review [location name] (you can fetch location name from the db using req.params.locationid)
	
problems/errors/bugs to fix: 
	- can't enter coordinates as floats

have to do's:
	- convert the distance from radian to a human readable one 
	- Use uploaded photos from the DB 
	- get Map using coordinates, better be interactibe map like ARPEJ's
	-Add opening/closing hours
